    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter or margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper - stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground back pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, 1 ½ teaspoons curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir in water until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the beef filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and diced Scotch bonnet pepper until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in ground beef; season with 1 teaspoon curry powder, allspice, ground cloves, thyme, pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Crumble in bouillon cube and stir in 1/2 cup of water and browning sauce until well combined; add bay leaf and simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove skillet from heat; discard bay leaf and stir in bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle.</li>
        <li>Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
